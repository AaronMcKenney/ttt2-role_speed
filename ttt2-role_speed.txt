The Speedrunner is a public evil role, who must act quickly to kill everyone else before their timer runs out. While the clock is still ticking they will be gifted with immense speed and will always respawn upon death. However, the minute that the timer hits zero they will permanently die.
 
The nature of the timer can be controlled in the ConVars listed below. In short the server admin has control over these aspects:
[olist]
    [*]The base time that the clock has, with a default value of 50 seconds
    [*]The added time that the clock has for each player, with a default of 10 seconds per player (ex. for a 6 player group, the timer would be 50 + 6*10 = 110 seconds)
    [*]The respawn time that the speedrunner must wait between lives, with a default value of 20 seconds. The clock is still ticking while the speedrunner is preparing to respawn, and this is meant to give all the other players a chance to recover and coordinate a plan
    [*]Time penalties and rewards, both set to 0 by default. Intended for those who desire risk and reward, these ConVars can alter the clock by subtracting time every time the speedrunner dies and adding time whenever the speedrunner kills a player who isn't on their team
[/olist]

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.
 
[h1]Normal Role Convars (also found in ULX):[/h1]
[code]# enable or disable this role
  ttt_speedrunner_enabled [0/1] (default: 1)
# the percentage of players that are spawned as this role
  ttt_speedrunner_pct [0.0..1.0] (default: 0.13)
# the limit of players that spawn as this role each round, this overwrites the percentage
  ttt_speedrunner_max [0..n] (default: 1)
# the probability each round of this role being spawned at all
  ttt_speedrunner_random [0..100] (default: 15)
# the amount of players needed for this role to spawn
  ttt_speedrunner_min_players: [0..n] (default: 6)[/code]
 
[h1]Rolespecific Convars:[/h1]
[code]# The number of seconds that the speedrunner has to win the game is based on the following formula:
  ttt2_speedrunner_time_base + n * ttt2_speedrunner_time_per_player
  Where n is the number of players who are currently alive and aren't currently on your team.
  ttt2_speedrunner_time_base [0..n] (default: 50)
  ttt2_speedrunner_time_per_player [0..n] (default: 10)
# Respawn time in seconds (Disabled if 0). Speedrunner will not respawn if they failed the speedrun.
  ttt2_speedrunner_respawn_time [0..n] (default: 20)
# If the speedrunner dies, this number of seconds is deducted from their timer.
  ttt2_speedrunner_time_penalty [0..n] (default: 0)
# If the speedrunner kills a player on a different team, this number of seconds is added to their timer.
  ttt2_speedrunner_time_reward [0..n] (default: 0)
# Should the opposition see a bunch of smoke when the Speedrunner spawns/dies/revives?
  ttt2_speedrunner_smoke_enable [0/1] (default: 1)
# Should the Speedrunner's body, role and team icon have a rainbow effect?
  ttt2_speedrunner_rainbow_enable [0/1] (default: 1)
# Multiplier for the Speedrunner's move speed
  ttt2_speedrunner_speed_scale [1.0..n.m] (default: 3.0)
# Multiplier for the Speedrunner's jump height
  ttt2_speedrunner_jump_scale [1.0..n.m] (default: 2.0)
# Multiplier for the Speedrunner's fire rate
  ttt2_speedrunner_fire_rate_scale [1.0..n.m] (default: 1.5)[/code]
